        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Lattes (or caffe lattes) are espresso drinks made with a fairly large amount of steamed milk. It is similar to a cappuccino, but a cappuccino is comprised of equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam, whereas a latte is made with much more milk than coffee. Lattes use a ratio of at least 1 shot of espresso to 2 ounces of steamed milk (this recipe is 1 to 3) and are capped with just a thin layer of foam on the top. This means lattes are milkier than cappuccinos, and because it has more steamed than foamed milk, the milk sinks into the espresso in a latte, while cappuccinos have three distinct layers.In America, it is common to add flavored syrups or powders when making lattes, including flavors such as vanilla, hazelnut, and caramel. In this recipe, the flavoring is optional, so you can customize the beverage or keep the coffee simple. To make any type of espresso drink, you will need an espresso maker; this recipe includes the steps for preparing and pulling shots.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Place the water in the espresso machine. Put the coffe in the portafilter. Tamp (press) the coffee down using a tamper. Do this 2 to 3 times to make sure the grounds are packed tightly. Place the portafilter into your espresso machine's group head and lock it in place by turning it to the right. </li>
                <li>Place a latte cup (or the glass carafe that came with your espresso machine) under the group head and pull the shot for 25 to 30 seconds. (Typically, there is a lever, switch, or button to start this process.)</li>
                <li>Pull the espresso shot, and start preparing the milk.</li>
                <li>Foam the milk. Place the milk into either a glass measuring cup or a small metal pitcher.</li>
                <li>Insert the steam wand into the container with the milk, just under the surface. Engage the steam wand on your espresso machine. (You may need to read your espresso machine's manual for this, as each espresso maker is a little different.) Make sure to keep the tip of the wand toward the side of the container. This will create a vortex with the milk. Move the container higher, lower, closer, then further so that the steam wand can incorporate the air into the milk, making the foam. The bubbles should get smaller and smaller as you do this. Once the milk has foamed to double its size, turn off the steam wand.</li>
                <li>Assemble the latte. Use a spoon to retain the microbubbles on top of the steamed milk and pour the bottom 2/3 of the steamed milk into the latte cup.</li>
                <li><h3>Serve and enjoy!</h3></li>
